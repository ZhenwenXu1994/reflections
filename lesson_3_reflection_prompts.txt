When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I want to share my work to public.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because sometimes I need to make some experience at local, but I don't want to show this part to public, and if Git keeps changing automatically, it will make confusion for my local work and remote.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are available only between repository hosted on GitHub. It makes copy of someone's repository on the GitHub, create link from the original repository and notifies the original author about the fork repository.
    Clones can happen between any two repositories, and the target repository can be in any machine including in the same one as the original repository with different spot.
    Branches are created inside of single git repository, and all users of the repository can access the branches.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
